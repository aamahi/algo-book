# Introduction 
My personal code-book to reuse code for **competitive programming also for reusable algorithm and data structure**.

# Getting Started
Anyone one can get code from here and play with it. Please, don't use code without understanding the meaning.

# Build and Test
The codes will be in python or C++. So, a [C++](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXW2VLrQ3Bs) compiler or [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) needed to be installed.
- Run the c++ code `$ g++ example.cpp` then  `.\a.exe` for windows, `./a.out` for ubuntu
- Run the python code `$ python example.py`

# Contribute
Anyone welcomed to play with code.
